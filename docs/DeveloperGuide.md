## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="300" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues a delete command.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="350" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)
The following is a (partial) class diagram of the `UI` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" width="900" alt="Structure of the UI Component" />

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TabSection`,
`ListSection` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the
commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The simplified sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking a delete
command as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" width="800" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for a delete command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g., during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="700" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* stores a `FilterDetails` object that represents the details of the most recent filter applied to the hall ledger data.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="800" />

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### How UI triggers command execution

Hall Ledger uses callback-style dependency injection to keep low-level UI components decoupled from command execution
details.

`MainWindow` holds the reference to `Logic` and implements small executor interfaces that match what child UI
components need.

The diagram below shows this flow: `MainWindow` implements `CommandExecutor` and `FilterExecutor`, then injects
itself into child components through their constructors. As a result, child components can request execution through
interfaces without knowing about `Logic` internals. For example, `CommandBox` only knows it has a `CommandExecutor` to
call when the user submits a command, and 'FilterPanel' only knows it has a `FilterExecutor` to call when the user
updates filter criteria.

<puml src="diagrams/find/UIExecutor.puml" width="700" />

`MainWindow` wires dependencies and defines the execution logic, then passes them into child UI constructors as
callbacks:

```java
public class MainWindow extends UiPart<Stage>
        implements CommandExecutor, FilterExecutor {

    public MainWindow(Logic logic) {
        commandBox = new CommandBox(this); // 'this' implements CommandExecutor
        filterPanel = new FilterPanel(logic.getFilterDetails(), this); // 'this' implements FilterExecutor
    }
}
```

Each child component triggers behavior only through these interfaces, without depending on parser or
`LogicManager` implementation details:

```java
// In CommandBox
CommandResult result = commandExecutor.execute(commandText);

// In FilterPanel
CommandResult result = filterExecutor.executeFilter(updatedFilterDetails);
```

This separation keeps responsibilities clear: UI components handle user input, while command and filter execution
remain centralized behind injected callbacks.

### Demerit point tracking

Hall Ledger stores demerit incidents as resident-level records instead of storing only a mutable running total.

Each demerit incident records:
* the DPS rule index,
* the rule title,
* the offence number for that resident and rule,
* the points applied for that occurrence,
* and an optional remark.

The resident’s total demerit points are **derived** by summing the points applied across all stored demerit incidents. This avoids duplicated derived state and keeps the resident’s demerit history auditable.

The demerit feature is split into two user-facing commands:

* `demeritlist` — displays the indexed demerit rule catalogue and point tiers.
* `demerit` — applies an indexed demerit rule to a resident identified by student ID.

#### Rationale for the current design

A resident may commit the same rule multiple times, and the DPS applies different point tiers based on repeated occurrences. Hence, storing only a running total would lose important context such as:
* which rule was applied,
* how many times it has already been committed by that resident,
* and what exact points were awarded for that occurrence.

By storing incidents individually, Hall Ledger can:
* reconstruct total demerit points at any time,
* preserve a readable incident history,
* and support future enhancements such as warnings, alerts, or administrative review.

#### Current scope note

Hall Ledger currently records resident demerit incidents and computes accumulated totals. It does **not** yet
automatically enforce semester-based or lifetime housing sanctions tied to DPS thresholds.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes a delete command to delete a resident in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes an add command to add a new resident. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the resident was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the earlier add command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

Hall Ledger is a desktop application for Resident Assistants (RAs) and other hall administrators who need to manage
resident contact records quickly and accurately. It is optimized for hall-level resident administration, where users
frequently need to search, update, and maintain resident details such as student ID, room assignment, contact
information, and emergency contact details.

Beyond basic resident record management, Hall Ledger is intended to support common hall-administration workflows such as
tagging residents by attributes (e.g. year of study, major, gender), monitoring occupancy at the room level, tracking
demerit incidents, and serving as a foundation for future hall-management features such as retention-related review and
other resident administration tasks.

Hall Ledger is not intended to replace university-wide housing allocation systems, payment systems, or institutional
access-control systems. Its scope is limited to block-level or hall-level resident management and operational tracking.

**Target user profile:**
* has a need to manage a significant number of resident records within a hall or block
* is a Resident Assistant (RA), hall administrator, or student leader handling resident administration
* frequently needs to search for residents by name, student ID, room number, or tagged attributes
* needs quick access to resident contact details and emergency contacts
* prefers a desktop app over manual spreadsheets or scattered notes
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI-style commands

**Value proposition:** Hall Ledger helps hall administrators manage resident records faster and with fewer errors than
spreadsheets or manual lists, while providing a centralized and command-driven workflow tailored to hall operations.

   1. Prerequisites: At least one resident exists in the list.

   1. Test case: `demerit i=A1234567X di=18`<br>
      Expected: A success message is shown. The resident's displayed demerit total increases according to the first-offence tier of rule 18.

   1. Test case: Repeat `demerit i=A1234567X di=18`<br>
      Expected: A success message is shown. The resident's displayed demerit total increases again according to the next offence tier.

   1. Test case: `demerit i=A9999999Z di=18`<br>
      Expected: No demerit is added. An error message is shown indicating that the resident was not found.

   1. Test case: `demerit i=A1234567X di=999`<br>
      Expected: No demerit is added. An error message is shown indicating that the rule index does not exist.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. Delete or rename the `data/addressbook.json` file, then relaunch the app.<br>
      Expected: Hall Ledger starts with sample data or an empty initialized data file instead of crashing.

   1. Edit `data/addressbook.json` into an invalid JSON format, then relaunch the app.<br>
      Expected: Hall Ledger detects that the data file cannot be loaded and starts safely without using the corrupted
      data.
